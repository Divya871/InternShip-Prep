Brtue force-TC=O(N)
A Simple Approach is to traverse the given array one by one and compare every element with given element ‘x’. If matches, then return index.

TC=O(N),SC=O(1)
 - We can use the given property that adjacent elemnents differ by one position
 - We'll start from 0th index & take the difference between it's value & target value. 
 - Now jump your index to difference as we're sure that if they're differ by one, it means target value can't occur in between

int search(int arr[], int n, int x)
{
    // Traverse the given array starting from
    // leftmost element
    int i = 0;
    while (i<n)
    {
        if (arr[i] == x)
            {return i;}
            
        i = i + abs(arr[i]-x);
    }
    return -1;
}
