TC=O(N),SC=O(1)
Method 1 (Linear Search) 

Algorithm to search ceiling of x: 

1) If x is smaller than or equal to the first element in array then return 0(index of first element) 
2) Else Linearly search for an index i such that x lies between arr[i] and arr[i+1]. 
3) If we do not find an index i in step 2, then return -1 


TC=O(log n)

Method-2 (Binary Search)
